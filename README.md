# Hotel-Management-Project-Using-Python-
My project title is “HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”. I have tried my level best to make the complicated process of Hotel management system as simple as possible using python code, tkinter and filehandling etc. Moreover I have used DFD’s (data flow diagrams) and ER Daigram (Entity Relationship Daigram) to explain the process to use the Hotel management system. I have tried to design the project in such a way that customer may not have any difficulties in using the hotel management system. The main purpose of my project is to perform each employee’s activity in computerized way rather than manually which is time consuming.
